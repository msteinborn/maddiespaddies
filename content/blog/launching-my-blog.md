# Why?
I decided I needed to get on the cool guy train and start to maintain a blog here; I am not much of a writer and my interests are varied to say the least. 

I am intending to use this space to capture some thoughts I have regarding a variety of topics such as trends in semiconductors/silicon/chip design, game design, the boston celtics, optimal leveling strategy in TES IV - really anything. I need to be as transparent as possible, while I am passionate about many of these things, these thoughts are largely those of a lay person. This whole thing is mostly an exercise in keeping a somewhat public journal, but hopefully this platform enables to become at least a marginally better writer now that I have some free time on my hands. 

I leave you with my latest obsession:

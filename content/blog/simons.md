## a wise man's insight
A wise man in Dallas once shared the following insight:

"Defense wins championships"

This last offseason the boston celtics decided to spin the variance wheel and take a stab at converting a known net negative value piece in Jrue Holiday for a high variance yet also negative mean asset in Anfernee Simons.

## the next big thing in ripcity

Some of us are old enough to remember when the murmurings out of portland were all about how Simon's was the next sure thing star. Trade podcasts from back in 2019 era always emphasized how sneakily high on Simons portland was. Dame identified him as the star to take the blazers to the promise land (a 45 win season and a second round exit)



## don't let the door hit you on the way out
So what ended up happening? 

Simons was ultimately traded for nothing. Actually Simons was traded for a mid 30 year old's point guards multi-year contract and **two** second round picks(!!!!) 

## this dude is such a bummer to watch on defense
Defensive metrics are a grab bag of trash, but in a world of garbage Simons is just about consistently the worst in all of these:

DPM?

Defensive Winshares?

STOCKS?

Eye Test?

What is strange is from looking at these games the man is clearly trying

## the shot making 
Many in the celtics media/podcast sphere have talked about how special his shotmaking can be; look I tried to be a hater on this but they are dead on.
